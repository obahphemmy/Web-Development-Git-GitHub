# Flexbox Module Challenge

The module challenge is the lab-task/assignment that students work through independently. This expands on the guided project completed earlier with the instructor.

## Web Development, Git and GitHub

## Objectives

- implement a CSS reset and understand why itâ€™s important for cross-browser development
- identify and explain all properties in the box model
- describe and understand that flexbox is a module
- demonstrate understanding of flex container properties in flex box

## Introduction

In this challenge you will be building a simple portfolio website based on a wireframe of your choosing using the CSS principles covered today.

Portfolio websites are a great way to show off your work to friends, family, and future employers. As you progress through Codebits Academy Career Accelerator Program you can update this site with projects you're proud of. Similarly, you can change the style, add a blog page, the possibilites are really endless.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Codebits' by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.
 
### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

Once your repository is set up, practice what you learned to create a portfolio site from the wireframe of your choosing. **You may choose any of the three wireframes in the "Wireframe Options" folder above.** Your complete project should look similar to the wireframe you chose, and include all of the following elements:

- [ ]  A navigation bar with `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` that link to the corresponding pages
- [ ]  Gallery of projects created with flexbox - you may use random images in place of project screenshots for now with the random image link: https://picsum.photos/ or you may use images that mean something to you
- [ ]  Information about you in place of the given placeholder
- [ ]  A `My Projects` button that links to the projects page
- [ ]  A `Contact Me` button that links to the contact page
- [ ]  Links to any social media profiles (Instagram, linkedIn, Twitter) into the footer section of your home page
- [ ] Host your website on GitHub pages

## FAQs

**What is a wireframe? How do I use one?**

*Wireframes are used to outline webpage styles, content, and functionality. UX designers will often use wireframes to explain their ideas to web developers. These wireframes, hand drawn or mocked up on software, are a cheap and easy way to iterate over designs. In this assignment you will choose a wireframe like the one below and create the elements with HTML and CSS.*
